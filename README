This is how I organize/sync my mendeley database using this scripts.

Mendeley sqlite database is moved to ~/Papers, which is linked back to orginial location. This way all papers and sqlite data are synchorized acros all machines. I turned off the cloud sync in my Mendeley.

I created a shell script mdl.sh and run it at startup. This will organize all pdfs into categories within ~/Papers

Be careful, backup your data before trying this.
