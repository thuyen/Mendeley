This is how I organize/sync my mendeley database

All papers are in ~/Papers, which is linked to dropbox
Mendeley sqlite database is move to ~/Papers, which is linked back to orginial location
This way all papers and sqlite data are synchorized acros all machine. I turn off the cloud sync in Mendeley.

I created a shell mdl.sh and run it at start up. This will organize files into categories within ~/Papers

Be careful, backup your data before trying this.
