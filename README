This is how I organize/sync my mendeley database using this scripts:

Mendeley sqlite database is moved to ~/Papers/Mendeley, which is linked back to orginial location. This way all papers and sqlite data are synchorized across all machines through dropbox. I turned off the cloud sync in my Mendeley.

I created a shell script mdl.sh at ~/Papers/Mendeley and run it at startup. This will organize all pdfs into categories within ~/Papers

Be careful, backup your data before trying this.
